**FastAPI Backend Application Summary**

This project is a web application built with FastAPI, designed to manage a rental service database. The application interfaces with a PostgreSQL database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on three main entities: Users, Items, and Orders.

Features:

    1. User Management:
        Create new users with unique email addresses.
        Retrieve a list of all users or a specific user by ID.
        Update user information.
        Delete users.

    2. Item Management:
        Add new rental items.
        Retrieve item details.
        Update item information.
        Delete items.

    3. Order Management:
        Place new orders linking users to rental items.
        Retrieve order details.
        Update order information.
        Delete orders.

Technologies Used:

    ~ FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
    ~ SQLAlchemy: The SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, used for database interactions.
    ~ PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
    ~ Docker: To containerize the application and ensure consistency across different environments.
    ~ Uvicorn: An ASGI web server implementation for Python, used to serve the FastAPI application.

**How to Run the Application Locally Using Docker:**

  1.  Clone the Repository:
          git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
          cd your-repository
  2.  Build Docker Images:
          docker-compose build
  3.  Start the Docker Containers:
          docker-compose up
  4.  Access the Application:
        Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
        Interact with the API using the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs.

Folder Structure:

    - main.py: The main entry point of the FastAPI application, containing route definitions for user, item, and order management.
    - models.py: Defines the database models (User, Item, Order) and establishes the database connection using SQLAlchemy.
    - requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required for the application.
    - Dockerfile: Contains instructions for building the Docker image for the FastAPI application.
    - docker-compose.yml: Defines the services (web and db) and configurations for running the application and PostgreSQL database in Docker containers.

Future Improvements:

    - Add authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Implement additional features for more comprehensive rental service management.
    - Enhance error handling and input validation.

This FastAPI backend application provides a robust foundation for managing rental services, leveraging the power of PostgreSQL for database operations and Docker for consistent deployment environments.
